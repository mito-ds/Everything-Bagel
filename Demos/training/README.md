# Training Demo

See the difference between O'Rilley training (which is very abstract and slow to deliver value) and the Mito training, which gets good quick.

For the Mito training, start with 01_Notebook.ipynb, and then depending on the training audience, either go to the the First Python Automation notebook (which is a vanguard automation notebook) or go to the Something Useful with Python notebook (which are smaller data cleaning, pivoting, etc. excercises)
